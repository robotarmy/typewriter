When you first use ruby to run 'typewriter_test.rb' you would see:
          undefined method `hello' for main:Object (NoMethodError)

  The test expects a method named 'hello' to exist.
  One way to solve this is by defining a method in typewriter.rb

Question:

  Regarding the error message which says '... for main:Object ... ' :

    Why does defining typewriter.rb like :
    #--- typewriter.rb
        def hello() 
        end
    #--- end typewriter.rb
    dismiss the error message about Object?

    Why does defining typewriter.rb like
    #--- typewriter.rb
      class Object
        def hello()
        end
      end
    #--- end typewriter.rb
      
    also dismiss the error message about Object?

    Why are these equivalent to ruby - What is happening?
